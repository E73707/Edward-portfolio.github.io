# Edwards Portfolio Web app

This Project was my first attempt at designing a web page from scrap. The web app is the beginning of my Portfolio and will grow in size and quality as i become more knowledgable and confident.

In the web app I included internal links in a nav bar, external links to social media platforms, incorporated images and images which acted as links to previous projects i have worked on

in the future i am hoping to add more projects to this web page as i grow

below are images of the application
